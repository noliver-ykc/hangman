# hangman

<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p> Hello and welcome to my basic Javascript Hangman game. This project was started Sept 6th 2022 and finished Sept 11th 2022. The main goals of this project were to practice DOM manipulation, Random function, and Event handlers. </p>
<p>This has been an exciting project to work on, and can be seen live here (<a href="https://noliver-ykc.github.io/hangman/" target="_blank">githubpages</a> ). </p>
